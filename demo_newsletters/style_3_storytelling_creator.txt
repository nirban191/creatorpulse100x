*A weekly letter about building, creating, and finding your voice*

---

Dear fellow creator,

Last Tuesday, I stared at a blank screen for three hours.

Not because I had nothing to sayquite the opposite. My mind was buzzing with ideas, each one fighting for attention like kids in a candy store. The problem? I was paralyzed by the need to make it "perfect."

Then something clicked.

I remembered a conversation I had with a ceramics artist in Kyoto. She told me: "The beauty is not in the perfect bowl. It's in the fingerprints left on the claythe evidence that human hands shaped it."

That's what I want to talk about today. The messy, imperfect, beautifully human process of creation.

## On Embracing the Rough Draft

Here's what nobody tells you about creating content: the first version always feels terrible. Always. Even after years of doing this, I look at my initial drafts and cringe.

But here's the secretthat first draft isn't meant to be good. It's meant to *exist*.

Think of it like a sculptor's clay. You can't refine what isn't there yet. The magic happens in the revision, in the shaping, in the courageous decision to hit "publish" even when that voice in your head says "not good enough."

This week, I challenge you: create something imperfect and share it anyway.

## The Content I'm Obsessed With

**Read:** James Clear's latest piece about identity-based habits. It fundamentally shifted how I think about building creative routines. Instead of "I want to write more," try "I am a writer." Notice the difference?

**Watched:** A 30-minute documentary about indie game developers. It reminded me why we create in the first placenot for the algorithm, not for the metrics, but because we have something that needs to come out of us.

**Discovered:** A Chrome extension called "Forest" that gamifies focus time. You plant a virtual tree that dies if you leave the tab. Sounds silly, but it's kept me off Twitter for longer stretches this week.

## The Lesson I'm Still Learning

I used to think consistency meant showing up every single day, no exceptions. Turns out, that's a fast track to burnout.

Real consistency is about the long game. It's okay to take a week off. It's okay to create "mediocre" work sometimes. It's okay to experiment and fail.

What matters is that you keep coming back. That you don't let one missed week turn into three months of silence.

Progress isn't linear. It's a squiggly line that generally trends upwardif you zoom out far enough.

## Your Turn

I want to hear from you. What's one creative project you've been putting off because it doesn't feel "ready" yet?

Reply to this email and tell me about it. I read every single response, and sometimes your story sparks ideas for future newsletters.

Remember: done is better than perfect. Imperfect action beats perfect inaction every time.

Now go make something wonderful.

With gratitude and clay-stained hands,

Maya

P.S. Next week, I'm sharing the exact content calendar system that helped me go from sporadic posting to consistent creation without burning out. Can't wait to show you.
