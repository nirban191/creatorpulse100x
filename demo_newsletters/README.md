## What to Look For After Training

After training, the AI should capture:
- **Tone:** Formal vs casual, serious vs playful
- **Structure:** Section patterns, opening/closing styles
- **Voice:** First-person vs third-person, direct vs indirect
- **Formatting:** Use of bullets, emojis, headers
- **Length:** Short punchy paragraphs vs long detailed sections

---

## Pro Tips

1. **More is Better:** Upload 3+ newsletters for best results
2. **Consistency Matters:** If you want a specific style, use newsletters that are similar
3. **Recent is Relevant:** Your most recent writing represents your current voice
4. **Experiment Freely:** You can retrain as many times as you want
5. **Mix and Match:** Try combinations to find your unique voice
