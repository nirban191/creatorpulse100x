## Option 2: Verify a Domain (Production Setup)

### Step 1: Get a Domain

You need to own a domain name. Options:

- **Recommended for newsletters**: Use your existing website domain

### Step 2: Add Domain to Resend

1. Go to: https://resend.com/domains
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`)
4. Or use a subdomain (e.g., `mail.yourcompany.com`)

### Step 3: Add DNS Records

Resend will provide DNS records to add:

**Example DNS Records:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: resend-verify-abc123xyz456...

Type: MX
Name: @
Priority: 10
Value: mx1.resend.com

Type: MX
Name: @
Priority: 20
Value: mx2.resend.com

Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQ...
```

**Where to add these:**
- If using Cloudflare: Dashboard ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Add Record
- If using Namecheap: Domain List ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Advanced DNS
- If using GoDaddy: Domain Settings ‚Üí DNS Management

### Step 4: Verify Domain

1. After adding DNS records (wait 5-60 minutes for propagation)
2. Go back to Resend dashboard
3. Click **"Verify Domain"**
4. Wait for green checkmark ‚úÖ

### Step 5: Update From Address

Once verified, update your `.env` file:

```bash
# Change from:
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=CreatorPulse <newsletter@resend.dev>

# To your verified domain:
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=CreatorPulse <newsletter@yourcompany.com>
```

### Step 6: Test Sending

Now you can send to any email address!
